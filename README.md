I decided to start the path of becoming a full stack developer on Monday 8th January 2024.

Web designing and developing was something I always wanted to learn, so I decided to go for it full time.

Hereby my lattest creation. This is a gift to my cousin, who plays in a band called "Proyecto Escrache"

I designed his website to see if they hire me as their Manager hehe

It has user authentification, it is connected to a free mySQL database, it has their own Blog, their own New Concerts display, their own shop display...I am quite happy with the final results, especially considering that I am working and studying/learning by myself in my free time

I don't know what will come next. I only know that the journey continues!
